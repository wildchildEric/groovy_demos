/*
    We must use caution when we send an array instead of discrete values.
    Groovy treats the values wrapped in square brackets [] as an instance of ArrayList,
    not of the plain vanilla array. So if we simply send, for example, [2, 3, 4, 5],
    weâ€™ll get a MethodMissingException. To send an array,
    either define a reference of the array type or use the as operator.
